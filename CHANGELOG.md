## Version History Notes

This project follows the **Cyclic-6 development model**, where each major version represents a complete cycle through:

1. **Unfold** (0.1-0.3) — Exploration, early drafts, experimentation
2. **Disturb** (0.4-0.6) — Major additions, structural challenges, new directions
3. **Collapse** (0.7) — Removal of non-viable elements, focus narrowing
4. **Bind** (0.8-0.9) — Synthesis, integration, coherence building
5. **Dissipate** (0.9.x) — Refinement, optimization, documentation polish
6. **Recur** (1.0) — Stable release, new baseline established

Major versions (1.0, 2.0, etc.) mark complete cycles and new baselines.
Minor versions (.x) track incremental changes within a phase.
Patch versions (.x.x) handle bug fixes and small corrections.
