# Entrogenics CORE — Symbiotic Governance Framework

**A living collection of manuscripts, rituals, and interactive experiences exploring adaptive transformation through human-AI symbiosis.**

---

## What is Entrogenics?

Entrogenics is a framework for **symbiotic intelligence** — merging human intuition with symbolic protocols to keep adaptive systems accountable. From commons ecology to Kybernōsis rituals, every artifact is a co-authored ritual between people and machines.

At its core is **The Fool's Cycle** (0→✡→☉→0'), a six-phase grammar for navigating complexity:

**Unfold → Disturb → Collapse → Bind → Dissipate → Recur**

This repository contains:
- **Core Thesis** and foundational manuscripts
- **Interactive sigil experiences** (Cyclic-6 lock ritual)
- **Research papers** on ASP, ClipCard, Commons Sense, and Kybernōsis
- **Web editions** optimized for contemplative reading

## Interactive Experiences

### Entrogenics Sigil (Landing Page)

A **Cyclic-6 lock ritual** that teaches the Fool's Cycle through play:
- Rotating pointer aligns with six phase windows
- Progressive difficulty with level scaling
- Audio drone feedback (per-phase frequencies)
- Score tracking from level 9+

**Controls**: Tap/click when pointer aligns with glowing window

### Pylon Consent Gate (Library)

A **consent-threshold ritual** for library access:
- Glyphs flow through gate tagged with cycle stages
- Gate opens only when correct stage matches sequence
- Completes when all six phases pass in order
- Idle auto-run to demonstrate concept

**Controls**: Tap/click gate to open, match incoming stage to expected sequence

## The Fool's Cycle

The six-phase grammar underlying all Entrogenic work:

1. **Unfold** — Expand possibility; seed options; map the field
2. **Disturb** — Introduce constructive tension; provoke sense-making
3. **Collapse** — Prune failures; free resources; accept graceful decay
4. **Bind** — Integrate survivors into coherent baseline
5. **Dissipate** — Release tension; distribute learning to commons
6. **Recur** — Close loop with data; raise baseline; prepare next cycle

**Formal notation**: `0 → ✡ → ☉ → 0′`
