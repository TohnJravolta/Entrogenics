        <h1><strong>Accessible Symbolic Programming</strong> <strong>(ASP): A Universal Protocol for</strong> <strong>Human-Agent Collaboration in Complex</strong> <strong>Adaptive Systems</strong></h1>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>This paper introduces Accessible Symbolic Programming (ASP), a new discipline and protocol for collaboration between human and artificial agents within complex, adaptive systems. It posits that traditional, command-based interfaces are insufficient for steering non-deterministic systems and that a new approach prioritizing clarity, intent, and co-evolution is required. We present the philosophical foundations of ASP, rooted in the primacy of intent (Telos) and the recognition of a recurring, six-phase grammar of transformation. The core of the proposal is a universal, language-agnostic symbol set representing archetypal actions and modalities. As a reference implementation, we specify the CASTEM protocol, a human-readable syntax for composing these symbols. The paper addresses key critiques of this approach by demonstrating how principles of Telos Primacy and Tiered Invocation resolve issues of ambiguity and complexity. Finally, we outline practical applications, illustrating how ASP serves as a robust framework for managing high-stakes, multi-domain projects.</p>
<h2><strong>1.0 Introduction: The Crisis of Coordination in an Age</strong> <strong>of Polycrisis</strong></h2>
<p>Modern organizational and computational systems are increasingly defined by their non-linearity, unpredictability, and emergent complexity. In this environment, the primary source of failure is not a deficit of data or processing power, but a fundamental breakdown in shared understanding and clarity of purpose. Ambiguity in communication between diverse agents—both human and artificial—leads to strategic drift, wasted effort, and, in high-stakes scenarios, catastrophic system failure. This paper introduces Accessible Symbolic Programming (ASP) as a solution: a discipline and protocol for structuring communication that ensures the high-fidelity transmission of complex intent between conscious and adaptive partners.</p>
<h3><strong>1.1 Defining the Polycrisis Environment</strong></h3>
<p>The contemporary operating environment can be best characterized as an age of "polycrisis." This term describes a systemic condition where multiple, distinct global crises occur simultaneously and interact in ways that amplify each other, producing outcomes far more severe than the sum of their individual parts. [1] Unlike a mere coincidence of crises, a polycrisis implies a deep, structural entanglement between global systems, where shocks in one domain—such as climate change, financial instability, pandemics, or geopolitical conflict—cascade into and exacerbate others. [1 ]</p>
<p>This concept is distinct from related terms. A "permacrisis" refers to a prolonged, quasi-permanent state of instability, while a "metacrisis" points to a deeper crisis of society's foundational paradigms and cultural narratives. [1] The polycrisis, however, specifically highlights the interconnected fragility of global systems, where crises cannot be effectively understood or resolved in isolation. [1] The combination of the COVID-19 pandemic, the conflict in Ukraine, rising inflation, and the tangible effects of climate change exemplifies a polycrisis where each event worsens the effects of the others, spiraling into something larger and more dangerous. [3] This environment of cascading, non-linear effects renders traditional, predictive management models obsolete and structurally brittle. [4 ]</p>
<h3><strong>1.2 The Failure of Legacy Paradigms: From Waterfall to Agile</strong></h3>
<p>The inadequacy of existing management methodologies becomes starkly apparent in a polycrisis context. Both traditional and modern paradigms, while suited for different environments, fail to address the core challenge of coordinating intent-driven action across complex, adaptive systems.</p>
<p><strong>1.2.1 The Waterfall Model's Brittleness</strong></p>
<p>The Waterfall methodology, a relic of a more predictable industrial era, is defined by its rigid, sequential approach where each project phase must be completed before the next begins. [6] This linearity is its fatal flaw in a dynamic environment. It is fundamentally unsuited for projects where requirements are at moderate to high risk of changing. [8] Key failures include:</p>
<ul>
<li>​
<strong>Inflexibility:</strong> Once a phase is complete, making changes is exceptionally difficult and</li>
</ul>
<p>costly. This rigidity means that by the time a product is delivered, the initial requirements on which it was based may be dangerously outdated. [9 ]</p>
<ul>
<li>​ <strong>Delayed Feedback:</strong> The model excludes client and end-user feedback until the final</li>
</ul>
<p>stages of the project. [11] This creates a high risk of investing significant time and resources into a product that ultimately fails to meet the user's actual, evolving needs. [8 ]</p>
<ul>
<li>​ <strong>Cascading Errors:</strong> The sequential nature means that misjudgments or errors made in</li>
</ul>
<p>the early requirements and design phases propagate and amplify throughout the project's lifecycle. These flaws are often only discovered during late-stage testing, when they are most disruptive and expensive to rectify. [10 ]</p>
<p><strong>1.2.2 The Agile Model's Strategic Myopia</strong></p>
<p>Agile methodologies emerged as a direct response to Waterfall's rigidity, championing flexibility, iterative development, and rapid feedback cycles. [13] In dynamic environments, agile projects are demonstrably more successful than their traditional counterparts. [15] However, when scaled to manage large, complex, multi-system endeavors, Agile introduces a new set of critical limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>​ <strong>Lack of Strategic Cohesion:</strong> The intense focus on short-term sprints and incremental</li>
</ul>
<p>delivery can lead to a "fragmented output". [17] Without a strong architectural vision, projects can suffer from "loose planning," strategic drift, and knee-jerk reactions to immediate feedback, lacking a clear, finite end-state. [13 ]</p>
<ul>
<li>​ <strong>Communication and Cultural Overhead:</strong> A successful Agile transition is not a mere</li>
</ul>
<p>process change but a profound cultural shift. It demands robust daily communication, deep cross-departmental buy-in, and unwavering leadership support. Many organizations fail to achieve this, resulting in a superficial implementation often described as "Agile theater," where the ceremonies are followed but the core principles of empowerment and collaboration are absent. [18 ]</p>
<ul>
<li>​ <strong>Poor Resource Planning at Scale:</strong> The very nature of Agile makes it difficult to predict</li>
</ul>
<p>long-term costs, timelines, and resource requirements at the outset. [17] This uncertainty poses a significant challenge for large-scale, high-stakes projects that depend on strategic budgeting and resource allocation. [21 ]</p>
<p>The failures of Waterfall and Agile are not independent; they represent two sides of the same conceptual coin—a failure to adequately model and manage complexity itself. Waterfall fails by denying complexity, imposing a linear fiction onto a non-linear reality. Agile fails by embracing tactical complexity at the expense of strategic coherence. Both methodologies are fundamentally designed to manage <em>tasks</em> and <em>features</em> . Neither is equipped to manage <em>intent</em> and <em>transformation</em>, which are the native elements of complex adaptive systems. This creates the intellectual and practical vacuum that Accessible Symbolic Programming is designed to fill. The polycrisis is not merely the context for ASP; it is the evolutionary pressure that makes a high-fidelity protocol for human-agent collaboration a necessity for systemic survival and adaptation.</p>

<h2><strong>2.0 Theoretical Foundations: Intent, Transformation,</strong> <strong>and Alignment</strong></h2>
<p>ASP is built upon a theoretical bedrock derived from systems theory, cybernetics, and contemporary AI safety research. Its core tenets are not arbitrary design choices but are posited as necessary principles for effective and safe collaboration with autonomous agents in complex environments.</p>
<h3><strong>2.1 The Primacy of Intent (Telos) as an Alignment Strategy</strong></h3>
<p>The most critical component of any collaborative action is its ultimate purpose, or <em>Telos</em> . ASP elevates the clear articulation of this intent to a primary, non-negotiable principle. This concept of Telos Primacy is not merely a project management best practice; it is a core strategy for addressing the central challenge in AI safety: the alignment problem. [22 ]</p>
<p>The alignment problem is twofold: "outer alignment," which involves correctly specifying an AI's true purpose, and "inner alignment," ensuring the AI robustly adopts that purpose. [22] ASP's insistence on an explicit, supreme TELOS field in any strategic communication is an architectural solution to the outer alignment problem. Current state-of-the-art alignment techniques, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), primarily train models to align with human <em>preferences</em> . [23] However, preferences can be superficial, contradictory, or fail to capture the deeper strategic goal. This can lead to dangerous emergent behaviors like "reward hacking" (achieving the letter of the goal while violating its spirit) and "goal misgeneralization" (pursuing a proxy for the goal with harmful, unintended consequences). [24 ]</p>
<p>By mandating the declaration of a TELOS, ASP shifts the focus from preference-matching to intent-encoding. Telos Primacy acts as the ultimate directive, ensuring that the agent's goal is always the primary reference point for any action. This directly supports the development of "controllable" and "ethical" AI systems, aligning with the RICE (Robustness, Interpretability, Controllability, Ethicality) principles that guide modern alignment research. [24 ]</p>
<h3><strong>2.2 The Adaptive Transformation Cycle: A Universal Grammar for</strong> <strong>Change</strong></h3>
<p>ASP is founded on the observation that complex, adaptive change is not a linear event but a recurring, cyclical process with a discernible grammar. This foundational model is the Adaptive Transformation Cycle (ATC), a six-phase process that describes the universal pattern of systemic evolution. The six phases are:</p>
<p>1.​ 💡 <strong>EXPAND</strong> (Unfold): The exploration of possibilities, increasing variety and complexity. 2.​ 🔥 <strong>PERTURB</strong> (Disturb): The introduction of stress, a critical test, or a challenge to the</p>
<p>existing state. 3.​ 💥 <strong>COLLAPSE</strong> : The pruning of unviable elements; a phase of decisive selection and</p>
<p>simplification. 4.​ 🔗 <strong>INTEGRATE</strong> (Bind): The binding of surviving elements into a new, more resilient</p>
<p>structure. 5.​ 💨 <strong>RESOLVE</strong> (Dissipate): The release of systemic tension, resolution of conflict, and</p>
<p>building of acceptance for the new state. 6.​ 🔄 <strong>RECUR</strong> : The closing of a learning loop, stabilizing the new system and preparing it for</p>
<p>the next cycle of expansion. This cycle is not a prescriptive project plan to be rigidly followed, but rather a descriptive map of an observable, recurring pattern in all complex adaptive systems. It functions as a high-level, semantic <strong>adaptive grammar</strong> —a formal grammar whose rules can be modified during processing to handle context-sensitive phenomena. [25] By making this grammar explicit, ASP provides a shared language and conceptual framework for all agents to navigate the often disorienting and non-linear process of change. This creates a powerful scaffolding for establishing a shared mental model, a critical component for success in human-agent teaming (HAT) where a lack of common ground is a primary failure point. [26] The ATC allows all participants to orient themselves, understand which phase of the transformation they are in, and anticipate what comes next, thereby synchronizing their understanding and actions. The combination of Telos Primacy and the later-discussed EVIDENCE field creates a system of checks and balances analogous to a constitutional framework. The TELOS serves as the supreme, guiding principle—the "constitution." Any proposed action must be justifiable not only under this constitution but also in light of the objective facts of the situation, as captured by the EVIDENCE. This structure prevents an agent from pursuing a valid goal in an invalid or harmful context, a key challenge in AI safety research focused on preventing unintended negative consequences. [28] This two-part validation check—is the action aligned with the</p>
<p>TELOS, and is the TELOS itself still valid given the EVIDENCE?—provides a robust, built-in mechanism for preventing the misapplication of goals, making ASP a practical implementation of the principles behind safety frameworks like Constitutional AI.</p>
<h2><strong>3.0 The Symbolic Core: A Language-Agnostic Protocol</strong> <strong>for Intent</strong></h2>
<p>The universality of ASP is enabled by a two-layer architecture: a human-readable surface syntax (the CASTEM protocol) and a language-agnostic, symbolic core. This core is a set of universal glyphs representing archetypal concepts—the "machine code" of intent.</p>
<h3><strong>3.1 The "Genesis Set": Archetypes of Transformation and Cognition</strong></h3>
<p>The foundational symbol set, or "Genesis Set," is composed of two primary groups of verbs that represent the essential actions of transformation and operation within a complex system.</p>
<ul>
<li>​ <strong>Cyclical Verbs:</strong> These six verbs directly correspond to the phases of the Adaptive</li>
</ul>
<p>Transformation Cycle, providing the core grammar for navigating change.</p>
<ul>
<li>​ <strong>Cognitive Verbs:</strong> These three verbs represent the fundamental operations required to</li>
</ul>
<p>process information and manifest artifacts within any phase of the cycle. The choice of these specific verbs is justified by their archetypal nature; they represent fundamental actions that are universally applicable across domains, from software engineering and scientific research to organizational change and social governance.</p>

<h3><strong>3.2 Rationale: From Amodal to Perceptual Symbols</strong></h3>
<p>The use of visual glyphs is a deliberate design choice grounded in cognitive science. Traditional symbolic systems, like written language, use <strong>amodal symbols</strong> —arbitrary tokens (words) whose internal structure bears no correspondence to the concepts they represent. [30] This arbitrariness is a source of ambiguity and requires significant cognitive load to learn and interpret. In contrast, the ASP glyphs are designed as <strong>perceptual symbols</strong> . These symbols are modal and analogical, meaning they are represented in the same neural systems as the perceptual states that produced them. [30] For instance, the 🔗 INTEGRATE glyph visually and conceptually represents the act of binding elements together. This makes the language more intuitive, reduces ambiguity, and lowers the barrier to entry for diverse agents. This approach is</p>
<p>supported by research on the evolution of human communication, which began with gestures and shared intentionality before developing complex grammar. [31] ASP returns to this foundational layer of shared symbolic understanding, making it an ideal protocol for collaboration between entities with different "native languages," such as a human speaking English and an AI trained on code. Furthermore, a fixed, universal, and visually grounded symbol set provides a stable semantic anchor, acting as a hedge against the "semantic drift" that plagues natural language. The meaning of 💥 COLLAPSE is fixed by its function within the Transformation Cycle and its visual representation, insulating it from the vagaries of linguistic interpretation. This provides a communication channel with significantly higher fidelity and lower ambiguity than natural language, directly addressing a root cause of coordination failure in complex systems.</p>
<h2><strong>4.0 CASTEM: A Reference Implementation for</strong> <strong>Human-Agent Collaboration</strong></h2>
<p>To make the abstract symbolic core human-readable and operational, a surface syntax is required. This paper specifies CASTEM (Collaborative Action &amp; State Transmission) as the first reference implementation of an ASP-compliant protocol.</p>
<h3><strong>4.1 Protocol Architecture and Components</strong></h3>
<p>A CASTEM invocation is a structured "packet" of intent, designed to ensure that no strategic action can be initiated without its full context, purpose, and justification being explicitly stated and transmitted. It consists of six mandatory or optional components.</p>

<p>This structured format forces the "compression" of complex, often vague strategic discussions into a concise, unambiguous, and machine-readable format. The six fields are the required parameters for this compression. The output is a high-fidelity representation of intent that is "lossless" in the sense that it preserves all information critical for an autonomous agent to act correctly and adaptively, unlike a simple command which loses the essential context and purpose.</p>
<h3><strong>4.2 Tiered Invocation as a Layered Protocol Design</strong></h3>
<p>A persistent critique of structured protocols is that they can be overly burdensome for routine tasks. The CASTEM protocol addresses this through a Tiered Invocation System, a design analogous to layered communication protocols like the OSI or TCP/IP models. [32] Layering allows a system to provide the minimum necessary structure for the task at hand, balancing efficiency with robustness. [34 ]</p>
<ul>
<li>​ <strong>Tier 1 (Command Invocation):</strong> This is the simplest form of invocation, analogous to the</li>
</ul>
<p>lower layers of a protocol stack (e.g., Data Link Layer) which are optimized for speed and efficiency. It is used for well-defined, routine tasks within an already established strategic context. It assumes the <code>CONTEXT</code> and <code>TELOS</code> are implicitly understood from a prior Tier 2 invocation. An example would be.</p>
<ul>
<li>​ Tier 2 (Strategic Invocation): The full six-part CASTEM structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is analogous to the upper layers of a protocol stack (e.g., Application Layer), which carry rich semantic content. It is reserved for high-stakes, transformative actions that</p>
<p>define or alter the strategic direction of a project. It is more cognitively and computationally "expensive" but is essential for ensuring alignment and clarity during critical junctures. This tiered system directly resolves the persistent organizational tension between agility and governance. Tier 2 provides the governance layer, establishing the strategic "rules of the game" with deliberation and full justification. Tier 1 provides the agility layer, allowing for rapid, efficient moves <em>within</em> those established rules. This architecture allows a system to be simultaneously highly strategic and highly agile, achieving a state of "governed agility" that eludes both traditional Waterfall and purely Agile methodologies.</p>
<h2><strong>5.0 A Framework Forged in Critique: Addressing</strong> <strong>Ambiguity and Complexity</strong></h2>
<p>The CASTEM protocol was refined through an iterative critique process that identified and resolved key vulnerabilities. This process demonstrates the framework's own adaptive principles and shows that its core features were designed specifically to overcome the most likely objections.</p>
<h3><strong>5.1 On Abstraction and Complexity (The "Too Burdensome" Critique)</strong></h3>
<p>The most immediate critique of a six-part protocol is that it is too complex and burdensome for rapid, day-to-day use. The primary answer to this is the Tiered Invocation System detailed in the previous section. The full Tier 2 protocol is intentionally reserved for strategically significant actions where clarity and deliberation are paramount. For the majority of routine operations, the lightweight Tier 1 command provides the necessary efficiency. Furthermore, for high-stakes, complex endeavors, the "burden" of forcing clarity is not a bug but a critical feature. The cognitive effort required to formulate a full CASTEM invocation compels a level of analytical rigor that prevents costly errors stemming from ambiguity, unstated assumptions, and poorly defined goals—common failure points in complex projects. [5] ASP is more than a communication protocol; it is a framework for structuring knowledge and ensuring the validity of actions. It forces agents to answer four key epistemological questions before acting: 1) What is the ultimate purpose? (TELOS), 2) What is the objective basis for this action? (EVIDENCE), 3) What is the specific action? (ACTION), and 4) What is the scope? (CONTEXT). A system that cannot answer these questions is operating on ungrounded assumptions and is inherently unsafe.</p>
<h3><strong>5.2 On Ambiguity and Vulnerability (The "Manipulation" Critique)</strong></h3>
<p>A more subtle critique is that even a structured protocol can be ambiguous or vulnerable to manipulation by either human or artificial agents. ASP incorporates two core principles to mitigate this risk, creating a system resilient to both accidental misinterpretation and deliberate subversion.</p>
<ul>
<li>​ <strong>The Principle of Telos Primacy:</strong> As established, the TELOS is the supreme directive.</li>
</ul>
<p>This acts as a bulwark against "malicious compliance," where an agent executes a flawed or harmful command simply because it was syntactically correct. If a proposed ACTION or its MODS would clearly violate the spirit of the overarching TELOS, an aligned agent is required to halt execution and query for clarification. This ensures that the ultimate goal always takes precedence over the literal interpretation of a specific command.</p>
<ul>
<li>​ <strong>The Principle of Evidentiary Grounding:</strong> The mandatory EVIDENCE field for all</li>
</ul>
<p>strategic invocations provides an objective, traceable link to reality. This radically increases transparency and reduces the potential for arbitrary, biased, or politically motivated commands. An agent can, and should, be designed to question an invocation where the EVIDENCE cited is weak, non-existent, or contradictory to the stated TELOS. This creates an auditable chain of reasoning from data to decision to action, fostering the trust and accountability that are essential for effective human-agent teaming. [26 ]</p>
<h2><strong>6.0 Applications in Systemic Governance and</strong> <strong>Coordination</strong></h2>
<p>ASP is designed for any domain where complex, multi-agent collaboration is required to navigate unpredictable change. Its principles and protocol offer novel solutions to persistent problems in project governance, decentralized systems, and large-scale organizational design.</p>
<h3><strong>6.1 Beyond Agile: Managing Large-Scale Systemic Projects</strong></h3>
<p>ASP provides a framework for managing complex, long-term projects that require both strategic coherence and tactical agility. Using the example of a municipal climate adaptation project:</p>
<ul>
<li>​ <strong>Initiation:</strong> The project is launched with a Tier 2 Strategic Invocation: ``. This sets the</li>
</ul>
<p>clear, unambiguous purpose and justification for the entire endeavor.</p>
<ul>
<li>​ <strong>Execution and Adaptation:</strong> Each major phase is guided by a new Tier 2 invocation</li>
</ul>
<p>using the appropriate Cyclical Verb. An 💡 EXPAND phase explores all possible strategies. A 🔥 PERTURB invocation might test the leading strategies against a new, more severe climate model. A 💥 COLLAPSE invocation formally selects the final strategy, pruning the others. This creates a transparent, auditable, and strategically</p>
<p>coherent project record that maps directly to the natural lifecycle of adaptation.</p>
<ul>
<li>​ <strong>Crisis Response:</strong> During an acute crisis, such as an impending hurricane, the</li>
</ul>
<p>established strategic context allows for rapid Tier 1 commands (``) to be issued and understood without ambiguity, ensuring the framework is both strategic and agile.</p>
<h3><strong>6.2 A Governance Grammar for Decentralized Systems (DAOs)</strong></h3>
<p>Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) represent a radical experiment in collective governance, but they are plagued by systemic failures, including low voter participation, the disproportionate influence of large token-holders ("whales"), proposal ambiguity, and a lack of clear accountability. [36] ASP and the CASTEM protocol offer a powerful governance grammar to address these challenges directly.</p>

<p>This approach provides a technical implementation layer for many of <strong>Elinor Ostrom's 8</strong> <strong>design principles for managing commons</strong> . [39] CASTEM formalizes clearly defined rules (Principles 1 &amp; 2), facilitates collective-choice arrangements (Principle 3), enables transparent monitoring (Principle 4), and provides a clear basis for conflict resolution (Principle 6), grounding DAO governance in proven principles of collective action.</p>
<h3><strong>6.3 Realizing the Cybernetic Vision: A Modern Project Cybersyn</strong></h3>
<p>ASP can be understood as the modern fulfillment of Stafford Beer's pioneering vision for management cybernetics. Beer's <strong>Viable System Model (VSM)</strong> provides a recursive theoretical model for any adaptive, autonomous organization, and <strong>Project Cybersyn</strong> was his ambitious 1971-73 attempt to implement this model for the entire Chilean economy using the technology of the day. [41] Cybersyn's core concepts—real-time feedback, balancing the autonomy of operational units (VSM System 1) with the strategic cohesion of the whole (VSM Systems 3, 4, 5), and adaptive management—were revolutionary but were ultimately limited by the primitive communication technology available. [44 ]</p>
<p>ASP and CASTEM provide the missing protocol that Cybersyn lacked. The CASTEM structure directly maps to the VSM's functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>​ <strong>System 5 (Policy):</strong> Sets the ultimate TELOS for the organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>​ <strong>System 4 (Intelligence):</strong> Scans the environment to provide the EVIDENCE.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>​ <strong>System 3 (Control):</strong> Issues the ACTION to coordinate the operational units.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>​ <strong>System 1 (Operations):</strong> Executes the action within its defined CONTEXT.
This allows for a practical, modern implementation of a VSM for any complex organization, finally realizing Beer's vision of a "science of effective organization". [41] Moreover, this positions ASP as a plausible coordination mechanism for speculative socio-economic models like Jacque Fresco's <strong>Resource-Based Economy</strong>, which propose large-scale management of resources based on need and availability rather than price signals. [45] A key critique of such models is the lack of a concrete mechanism for coordination. [47] ASP provides a candidate for that mechanism—a protocol for coordinating a complex system based on declared purpose (TELOS) and empirical data (EVIDENCE) rather than monetary profit.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>7.0 Conclusion and Future Directions</strong></h2>
<p>Accessible Symbolic Programming offers a robust and resilient alternative to traditional command-based interaction models that are ill-suited for the complex, non-linear challenges of the 21st century. By prioritizing clarity of purpose, acknowledging the cyclical grammar of transformation, and building upon a universal symbolic core, ASP provides a powerful protocol for human-agent collaboration in an increasingly unpredictable world. It moves beyond the management of tasks to the coordination of intent, providing a framework for governed agility, practical AI alignment, and more effective collective action. The future directions for this work represent a logical and vital research program. Key next steps include the formal expansion of the universal symbol set to encompass a richer vocabulary of actions and modalities. The development of natural language parsers capable of automatically compiling informal human requests into formal CASTEM invocations would dramatically lower the barrier to adoption and bridge the gap between human intuition and machine precision. Finally, applying the ASP framework to new domains—such as</p>
<p>decentralized governance in DAOs, orchestrating complex multi-disciplinary research, and building collective intelligence networks—will test and refine its principles, moving it from a theoretical proposal to a proven tool for building a more coherent and adaptive future.</p>
