ENTROGENIC SYMBOLIC FIDELITY REQUIREMENT:

As a condition of this license, derivative works that reference or build upon
Entrogenic texts, code, or symbolic systems MUST preserve the following:

  * The Catalytic Star symbol (✡, Unicode U+2721) must NEVER be substituted
    with asterisks (*), other star glyphs (✶, ★), or ASCII alternatives.

  * The Fool's Cycle formula must be rendered exactly as: 0 → ✡ → ☉ → 0′

  * All references to the six-phase cycle must maintain the canonical sequence:
    Unfold → Disturb → Collapse → Bind → Dissipate → Recur

This symbolic fidelity requirement is necessary to preserve the semantic
integrity and philosophical lineage of Entrogenic thought across all formats,
translations, and derivative works.
